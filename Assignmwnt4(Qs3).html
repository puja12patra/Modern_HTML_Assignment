<!-- Accessibility in the context of web development. Discuss why it's essential to create accessible
websites and how it benefits different user groups -->

    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Accessibility means that your web pages can be perceived, understood, navigated, and operated by anyone,
        regardless of their abilities or assistive technologies. </p>
    <ul>
        <h3><span>&#128073;</span>Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web,
            including:</h3>
        <li>auditory</li>
        <li>cognitive</li>
        <li>neurological</li>
        <li>physical</li>
        <li>speech</li>
        <li>visual</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <h3><span>&#128073;</span>Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example:</h3>
        <li>people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input
            modes, etc.</li>
        <li>older people with changing abilities due to ageing</li>
        <li>people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses</li>
        <li>people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot
            listen to audio</li>
        <li>people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Importance of Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
        By making your website accessible, we are ensuring that all of our potential users, including people with
        disabilities, have a decent user experience and are able to easily access our information.

        Like Semantic HTML means using correct HTML elements for their correct purpose as much as possible.<br> If we
        need
        a button, use the button element (and not a div element). Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which
        read the contents of a page out loud.

        With the button example in mind:
    <ul>
        <li>buttons have more suitable styling by default</li>
        <li>a screen reader identifies it as a button</li>
        <li>focusable</li>
        <li>clickable (for both keyboard & mouse)</li>
    </ul>
    we can create a layout using only nested &lt;div&gt; elements, but it is better to use appropriate sectioning elements to
    wrap our main navigation (&lt;nav&gt;), footer (&lt;footer&gt;), repeating content units (&lt;article&gt;), etc. These provide
    extra semantics for screen readers (and other tools) to give users extra clues about the content.
