    <h1><span>&#128073;</span>Below are 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML:</h1>
    <ol>
        <h2>
            <li>Ensure That You Always Use Semantic HTML
        </h2>
        <p> ‘Semantic HTML' refers to clean coding that clearly defines each section of our site in chronological order:
            As we’ve already mentioned, many users with disabilities rely on screen readers to navigate websites. When
            this type
            of assistive device scans a web page, it collects information based on the page's HTML structure. Unclear or
            messy
            HTML code with unnecessary additions will be more difficult for the screen reader to make sense of.
        </p>
        </li>
        <h2>
            <li>Add ‘Alt Text' to Your Site’s Images
        </h2>
        <P>Visual elements like images are an accessibility barrier to blind users and those with low vision.
            They often have to rely on assistive technologies such as Screen Reader.
            Screen Readers are software programs that read the text on the screen using a synthesizer.
            So, we need to add Alt Text to describe your images to disabled users.</P>
        </li>
        <h2>
            <li> Add Keyboard Navigation
        </h2>
        <p>For blind and visually impaired users, navigation is a challenge.
            Make sure disabled users can access all interactive elements of your website, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>URLs.</li>
            <li>Anchor text.</li>
            <li>Drop-down menus.</li>
            <li>Widgets.</li>
            <li>Forms.</li>
            <li> CTAs.</li>
            <li>Dialog boxes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> We can use HTML links, buttons, and form fields alone to make sure all elements of our website are
            keyboard-accessible.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
